\section{Nonlinear System Dynamics}
Consider the non-linear system \[
	\diff[]{x}{t} = f(x, t).
\]
\begin{definition}
	The system is autonomous if $f(x, t)$ is not explicitly dependent on time $t$.
	\label{defn:autonomous-system}
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	A point $x_0$ is an equilibrium point at time $t_0$ if \[
		\forall t \geq t_0, \ f(x_0, t) = 0 
	\]
	\label{defn:equilibrium-point}
\end{definition}
\subsection{Planar Dynamical Systems}
Planar dynamical systems are those with 2 state variables.
Suppose we linearize the system $\diff[]{\bs{x}}{t} = f(\bs{x})$ at an equilibrium point.
\[
	\diff[]{\bs{x}}{t} = D_f|_{\bs{x} = \bs{x_0}}\bs{x} 
\]
Depending on the eigenvalues of $D_f$, the Jacobian, we get several cases for
how this linear system behaves. We'll let $z_1$ and $z_2$ be the eigenbasis of
the \textit{phase space}.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The eigenvalues are real, yielding solutions $z_1 = z_1(0)e^{\lambda_1
		t}, z_2 = z_2(0)e^{\lambda_2 t}$. If we eliminate the time variable, we can
		plot the trajectories of the system.
		\[
			\frac{z_1}{z_1(0)} = \left(\frac{z_2}{z_2(0)}\right)^{\frac{\lambda_1}{\lambda_2}}
		\]
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item When $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 < 0$, all trajectories converge to the origin, so we call this a \textbf{stable node}.
			\item When $\lambda_1, \lambda_2 > 0$, all trajectories blow up, so we call this an \textbf{unstable node}.
			\item When $\lambda_1 < 0 < \lambda_2$, the trajectories will converge to
				the origin along the axis corresponding to $\lambda_1$ and diverge along
				the axis corresponding to $\lambda_2$, so we call this a \textbf{saddle node}.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item There is a single repeated eigenvalue with one eigenvector. As before,
		we can eliminate the time variable and plot the trajectories on the $z_1$,
		$z_2$ axes.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item When $\lambda < 0$, the trajetories will converge to the origin, so
				we call it an \textbf{improper stable node}
			\item When $\lambda > 0$, the trajetories will diverge from the origin, so
				we call it an \textbf{improper unstable node}
		\end{enumerate}
	\item When there is a complex pair of eigenvalues, the linear system will have
		oscillatory behavior. The Real Jordan form of $D_f$ will look like \[
			D_f = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha & \beta \\ -\beta & \alpha \end{bmatrix}.
		\]
		The parameter $\beta$ will determine the direction of the trajectories
		(clockwise if positive).
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item When $\alpha < 0$, the trajectories will spiral towards the origin,
				so we call it a \textbf{stable focus}.
			\item When $\alpha = 0$, the trajectories will remain at a constant radius
				from the origin, so we call it a \textbf{center}.
			\item When $\alpha > 0$, the trajectories will spiral away from the
				origin, so we call it an \textbf{unstable focus}.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
It turns out that understanding the linear dynamics at equilibrium points can be helpful in
understanding the nonlinear dynamics near equilibrium points.
\begin{theorem}[Hartman-Grobman Theorem]
	If the linearization of a planar dynamical system $\diff{\bs{x}}{t} =
	f(\bs{x})$ at an equilibrium point $\bs{x_0}$ has no zero or purely imaginary eigenvalues, then there exists a
	homeomorphism from a neighborhood $U$ of $x_0$ into $\mathbb{R}^2$ which takes
	trajectories of the nonlinear system and maps them onto the linearization
	where $h(\bs{x_0}) = 0$, and the homeomorphism can be chosen to preserve the
	parameterization by time.
	\label{thm:hartman-grobman}
\end{theorem}
\Cref{thm:hartman-grobman} essentially says that the linear dynamics predict the
nonlinear dynamics around equilibria, but only for a neighborhood around the
equilibrium point. Outisde of this neighborhood, the linearization may be very
wrong.

Non-linear systems can also have periodic solutions.
\begin{definition}
	A closed orbit $\gamma$ is a trajectory of the system such that $\gamma(0) =
	\gamma(T)$ for finite $T$.
	\label{defn:closed-orbit}
\end{definition}

Suppose that we have a simply connected region $D$ (meaning $D$ cannot be
contracted to a point) and we want to know if it contains a closed orbit.
\begin{theorem}[Bendixon's Theorem]
	If $\divergence(f)$ is not identically zero in a sub-region of $D$ and does not
	change sign in $D$, then $D$ contains no closed orbits.
	\label{thm:bendixons}
\end{theorem}
\Cref{thm:bendixons} lets us rule out closed orbits from regions of
$\mathbb{R}^2$.
\begin{definition}
	A region $M \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is positively invariant for a trajectory
	$\phi_t(\bs{x})$ if $\forall x\in M, \forall t \geq 0, \phi_t(\bs{x}) \in M$.
	\label{defn:positive-invariance}
\end{definition}
A positively invariant set essentially means that once a trajectory enters the
set, it cannot leave. That means all of the vector field lines must point inside
the set.
If we have a positively invariant region, then we can determine whether it
contains closed orbits.
\begin{theorem}[Poincare-Bendixson Theorem]
	If $M$ is a compact, positively invariant set for the flow $\phi_t(\bs{x})$,
	then if $M$ contains no equilibrium points, then $M$ has a limit cycle.
	\label{thm:poincare-bendixson}
\end{theorem}
