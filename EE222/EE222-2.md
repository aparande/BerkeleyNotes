### Definition 19

$$M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$$ is a $$m$$-dimensional smooth sub-manifold of $$\mathbb{R}^n$$ if $$\forall \boldsymbol{p}\in M,\ \exists r > 0$$ and $$F: B_r(\boldsymbol{p}) \to \mathbb{R}^{n-m}$$ such that 

$$ \begin{aligned} M \cap B_r(\boldsymbol{p}) = \{\boldsymbol{x}\in B_r(\boldsymbol{p}) | F(\boldsymbol{x}) = 0\},\\ F\text{ is smooth,}\\ \forall \bar{\boldsymbol{x}} \in M \cap B_r(\boldsymbol{p}), \text{Rank}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}} \bigg\rvert_{\bar{\boldsymbol{x}}}\right) = n - m \end{aligned} $$

{% endhint %}

By Definition 19, a manifold is essentially defined as the 0-level set
of some smooth function $$F$$ and can be thought of as a surface
embedded in a higher dimension.

### Definition 20

The tangent space of a manifold $$M$$ at $$\boldsymbol{p}\in M$$ is given by 

$$ T_{\boldsymbol{p}}M = \text{Null}\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial \boldsymbol{x}}\bigg |_{\boldsymbol{p}}\right) $$

{% endhint %}

The tangent space consists of all vectors tangent to the manifold at a
particular point $$\boldsymbol{p}$$.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 21

The Tangent Bundle of a manifold $$M$$ is the collection of all tangent spaces 

$$ T_M = \bigcup_{\boldsymbol{p}\in M} T_{\boldsymbol{p}} M $$

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 22

A vector field $$f:M\to T_M$$ on a manifold $$M$$ is an assignment of each point $$\boldsymbol{p}\in M$$ to a vector in the tangent space in that point $$T_{\boldsymbol{p}}M$$.

{% endhint %}

Therefore, a vector field can be thought of as a curve through the
tangent bundle of a manifold.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 23

The Lie Derivative of a function $$V$$ with respect to a vector field $$f$$ is
given by 

$$ L_fV = (\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}V)^\top f(\boldsymbol{x}). $$

{% endhint %}

A Lie Derivative is essentially a directional derivative, and it
measures how a function changes along a vector field.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 24

Suppose that $$f(\boldsymbol{x})$$ and $$g(\boldsymbol{x})$$ are vector fields. The Lie Bracket of
$$f$$ and $$g$$ is given by 

$$ [f, g] = L_fg - L_gf $$

{% endhint %}

The Lie Bracket is another vector field, and it essentially measures the
difference between moving along vector field $$f$$ and vector field
$$g$$ across some infinitesimal distance. Another way to think about the
Lie Bracket is as a measure of the extent to which $$f$$ and $$g$$
commute with each other. The Lie Bracket is also sometimes denoted using
the adjoint map

$$\text{ad}_fg = [f, g].$$

It is helpful when chaining Lie Brackets since we can denote

$$[f,[f,[f,\cdots[f,g]]]] = \text{ad}_f^ig.$$

Since the Lie Bracket is a vector field, we can look at Lie Derivatives
with respect to the Lie Bracket of two vector fields.

### Theorem 4

For a function $$h$$ and vector fields $$f$$ and $$g$$, 

$$ L_{[f,g]}h = L_fL_gh - L_gL_fh $$

{% endhint %}

We can also use relate repeated Lie Derivatives to doing repeated Lie
Brackets.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Theorem 5

$$ L_gL_f^ih(\boldsymbol{x}) = 0 \Leftrightarrow L_{\text{ad}_f^ig}h(\boldsymbol{x}) = 0 $$

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 25

Suppose $$f_1,f_2,\cdots,f_n$$ are vector fields. A distribution $$\Delta$$ is the
span of the vector fields at each point $$\boldsymbol{x}$$: 

$$ \Delta(\boldsymbol{x}) = \text{span}\{f_1(\boldsymbol{x}), f_2(\boldsymbol{x}),\cdots,f_n(\boldsymbol{x})\}. $$

{% endhint %}

At each point $$\boldsymbol{x},\ \Delta(\boldsymbol{x})$$ is a subspace
of the tangent space at $$\boldsymbol{x}$$.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 26

The dimension of a distribution at a point $$\boldsymbol{x}$$ is given by 

$$ \text{Dim }\Delta(\boldsymbol{x}) = \text{Rank}\left(\begin{bmatrix} f_1(\boldsymbol{x}) & \bigg\lvert & f_2(\boldsymbol{x}) & \bigg\lvert & \cdots & \bigg\lvert & f_n(\boldsymbol{x}) \end{bmatrix}\right) $$

{% endhint %}

Distributions have different properties which are important to look at.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 27

A distribution $$\Delta$$is nonsingular, also known as regular, if its
dimension is constant.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 28

A distribution $$\Delta$$ is involutive if 

$$ \forall f, g\in \Delta, \quad [f, g] \in \Delta $$

{% endhint %}

In involutive distributions, you can never leave the distribution by
traveling along vectors inside the distribution.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Definition 29

A nonsingular $$K$$-dimensional distribution $$\Delta(\boldsymbol{x}) = \text{span}\{f_1(\boldsymbol{x}), \cdots, f_k(\boldsymbol{x})\}$$ is completely integrable if
$$\exists \phi_1,\cdots,\phi_{n-k}$$ such that $$\forall i,k,\ L_{f_k}\phi_i = 0$$
and $$\nabla_{\boldsymbol{x}}\phi_i$$are linearly independent.
\\label{thm:involutive}

{% endhint %}

It turns out that integrability and involutivity are equivalent to each
other.

{% hint style="info" %}

### Theorem 6 (Frobenius Theorem) {#theorem-6}

A nonsingular $$\Delta$$ is completely integrable if and only if $$\Delta$$is
involutive.
