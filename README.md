# Introduction

While taking courses at the University of California, Berkeley, I have created detailed notes for many of the classes I have taken. In particular, I have notes for

1. EE16B: Designing Information Devices and Systems II
2. EE120: Signals and Systems
3. EE123: Digital Signal Processing
4. EECS126: Probability and Random Processes
5. EECS127: Optimization Models in Engineering
6. EE128: Feedback Control
7. EECS225A: Statistical Signal Processing
8. CS61B: Data Structures
9. CS61C: Machine Structures

These notes exist as PDFs on [my website](https://anmolparande.com/resources) and also here in this book. If you don't see notes from the list above in this book, I have not converted them, and you should use the PDF from the website.

All of these notes are from the semester in which I took the course, so they may be different from the current offering of the course. If you find any inaccuracies, please make an issue or a pull request on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aparande/BerkeleyNotes).
