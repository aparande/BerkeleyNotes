# Introduction to Control

The general goal of control is to get some physical system to respond to
a reference input in the way we would like.

{% hint style=\"info\" %}

### Definition 1

  The plant is the physical system which we would like to control.
  

{% endhint %}

In general, there are two different types of control.

{% hint style=\"info\" %}

### Definition 2

  Open-Loop control is where we pass a reference directly to the actuator to control the plant (see figure 1).
  

{% endhint %}

Open-Loop control is generally difficult because the disturbances make
it difficult to copy the reference exactly.

{% hint style=\"info\" %}

### Definition 3

  Closed loop control is using the output of our system and comparing it to the reference in order to generate the control signal (see figure 2).
  

{% endhint %}

Notice how the output signal is subtracted from a reference signal, and
we use the difference (a.k.a the error) to determine what input we pass
into the plant.

{% hint style=\"info\" %}

### Definition 4

  The control law $$K(e)$$ is a function of error applied by the controller to determine the inputs to the plant.
