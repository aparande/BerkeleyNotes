### Theorem 16

Every square matrix $$A$$ satisfies its own characteristic polynomial if there are no repeated eigenvalues.


$$ \Delta(A) = 0 $$

{% endhint %}

$$\Delta(\lambda) = |\lambda I - A| = \lambda^n + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i \lambda^i$$

In the case where $$A$$ is diagonalizable (i.e $$A = P\Lambda P^{-1}$$),

$$\Delta(A) = P\left[ \Lambda^n + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_i \Lambda^i \right]P^{-1}.$$

$$\Lambda^n + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_i \Lambda^i$$ is itself a diagonal
matrix where the jth entry on the diagonal is

$$\lambda_j^n + \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_i\lambda_j = 0$$

since $$\lambda_j$$ is a root of the characteristic polynomial. Thus
$$\Delta(A) = P \cdot 0 \cdot P^{-1} = 0$$, and

$$-A^n = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_iA^i.   \qquad (20)$$

This also gives us a new way to find $$e^{At}$$ because by its Taylor
series expansion,

$$e^{At} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}A^k.$$

By Equation 20, all $$A^k = A^{n}A^{k-n}$$ for $$k>n$$ can be expressed
in terms of the lower powers $$A^i$$ for $$i\in[0, n)$$.

### Theorem 17

$$ e^{At} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i(t)A^i $$

 for some $$\alpha_i$$ which are solutions to the equations


$$ e^{\lambda_jt} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\alpha_i(t)\lambda_j^i. $$
