## Theory of Distributions

The Theory of Distributions is the mathematical framework which
underlies the generalized Fourier Transforms.

### Definition 41

Given a test function $$x$$, a distribution $$T$$ operates on $$x$$ to produce a number $$<T,x>$$.

### Definition 42

The distrbution induced by a function $$g$$ is defined as


$$ <T_g, x> = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{g(t)^*x(t)dt} $$

{% endhint %}

Notice two things:

-   $$<T_g, x>$$ is linear

-   $$<\alpha T_g, x> = \alpha^*<T_g, x>$$

With these definitions, we can now define the Dirac delta in terms of
distrubions. Let $$g$$ be any function such that

$$\int_{\infty}^{\infty}{g(t)dt} = 1$$

Define $$g_\epsilon$$ to be

$$g_\epsilon = \frac{1}{\epsilon}g(\frac{t}{\epsilon})$$

Now we can defined
$$\delta(t) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}{T_{g_\epsilon}}$$

$$<\delta, x> = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{\delta(t)x(t)dt} = x(0)$$

which is the property of the Dirac Delta we want. Now we can define the
generalized Fourier Transform in terms of distributions.

### Definition 43

The generalized Continuous Time Fourier Transform of a distrubtion $$T$$ is


$$ <FT, X> = 2\pi<T, x> $$


for test function $$x$$ whose Fourier Transform is $$X$$
